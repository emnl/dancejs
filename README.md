# Dancejs

Dancejs is diet Haskell in Javascript (and CoffeeScript). It's kind of a step-sister to [Underscore](http://underscore.com).
While Underscore has its strict ways, Dancejs, released under the BeerWare
license, does functional things a bit more out of hand and awesome.

Basically you can do gnarly functional programming in [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) and Javascript.

Dance is **STRONGLY** influenced by [Haskell](http://haskell.org/) and its
standard library.

(dance.min.js 4KB < underscore-min.js 12KB)

## TODO

The tests needs to be rewritten into a more coffee-like syntax.
The readme also needs a bit of work, a few coffee/javascript examples would also be nice.

## Usage

Just require the dance.js file, alt dance.min.js.

Dance depends on Node and [Vows](http://vowsjs.org/) for testing.
Compiling Dancejs requires [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/).

Compiling is easy:

```
coffee -c dance.coffee
```

Testing is even easier:

```
node test/array_spec.js
node test/number_spec.js
node test/object_spec.js
```

To Dance in the browser, just include the dance.js file:

``` html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dance.js"></script>
```

Vows may be installed with npm.

## Examples

This is an example in CoffeeScript:

```javascript
insertion_sort = (xs) ->
  if xs.empty then return []
  return (insertion_sort xs.tail).insert xs.head
```

Further examples can be found under the Dancemv (Move-implementation) page, [examples](https://github.com/emnl/dancemv/tree/master/examples).

## Functions

Included functions are:
tail, head, last, init, empty, _reverse, rev, add, append, fadd, map, foldl, foldr, and, or, sum, product, _concat, conc, any, all, concatMap, maximum, minimum, insert, delete, del, replicate, take, drop, takeWhile, dropWhile, group, elem, NotElem, find, filter, zip, even, odd, minimumBy, maximumBy, insertBy, deleteBy, sortBy, groupBy

To find out what each of these do, please read the source, the tests or the [Haskell List](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Data-List.html) documentation.

Those functions which do not require any parameters are used as vars, ie array.tail,
not array.tail() - just like Ruby (<3).

## Performance

Please note that this library favors recursion. I do not fully know what implication it
will have on your software.

Also note that this library adds to the standard Array, Number and Object libraries.
Dance was designed to be neutral and easy.
